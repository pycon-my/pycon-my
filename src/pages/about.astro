			Since it’s first inception in 1991, the usage of the Python
			programming language has increased explosively in the past years.
			Python is now being used in multitude industries, from the web, to
			film production in Industrial Light and Magic and even for NASA.
			<br /><br />
			PyCons are conferences about Python and usually done by grassroots volunteers
			within their geographical area. PyCon started first in the United States
			in 2003 in Washington D.C, and have grown worldwide and done yearly in
			many regions and countries like Europe, Japan, Australia, Singapore,
			China South Korea, India and Malaysia.
			<br /><br />
			Malaysia had its first mini PyCon in 2014. In 2015, we had our first
			big PyCon MY. After organizing PyCon MY for many years, we realized that
			getting the Python community to get together for a few days a year to
			share knowledge and compare experiences allows the growth of ideas and
			also the exchange of skills, which will lead to a spillover of greater
			cooperation even after the conference is over. Stronger ties between
			developers and users of Python can be nurtured better when there is real
			human interaction, which is a big plus to the community. But we need
			to have continuity and provide the opportunity for people to get together
			to see the effects in the long run, and just providing a space for a
			few days a year for people to get together doesn’t seem to be enough.
			There should be more to that, because continuity and horizontal connections
			are the key.
			<br /><br />
			In order for us to have continuity and transparency going forward (especially
			concerning sponsorship monies), on 17th Dec 2015, we have incorporated
			PYCON MY PLT (LLP0006642-LGN) as a Limited Liability Partnership under
			the laws of Malaysia.

			As defined in its contract of incorporation, PYCON MY PLT’s purpose are
