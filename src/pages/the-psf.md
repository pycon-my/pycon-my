The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and
advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the
growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

### The following is the official mission statement of the PSF

_The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a non-profit membership organization
devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming
language. It qualifies under the US Internal Revenue Code as a tax-exempt
501(c)(3) scientific and educational public charity, and conducts its business
according to the rules for such organizations._

### The PSF

1. Python language itself, its standard libraries and documentation, installers,
   source code, educational materials, and assorted tools and applications.
2. Establishes PSF licenses, ensuring the rights of the public to freely obtain,
   use, redistribute, and modify intellectual property held by the PSF.
3. Works with the Open Source Initiative to ensure that PSF licenses conform to
   the Open Source Definition.
4. Holds Python's intellectual property rights for releases 2.1 and following.
5. Seeks to obtain the intellectual property rights for Python releases prior to
   2.1, for relicensing under the PSF Python license, to relieve the legal
   burden on Python's users. The PSF may also seek rights to other
   Python-related software for relicensing under a PSF license.
6. Protects the Python name, and the names, service marks and trademarks
   associated with all other intellectual property held by the PSF.
7. Solicits and manages contributions to the Python codebase, and may perform
   these services on behalf of other open source Python-related codebases.
8. Raises funds to support PSF programs and services. The regulations for public
   charity funding are complex. Some consequences are that the vast bulk of
   funding must come from private contributions (including sponsoring
   memberships) and public grants, must come from a broad base, and that no
   single private donor can supply a substantial percentage of the PSF's total
   funding. Additional revenue may be pursued in ways consistent with
   then-current rules for public charities and with Python's standing as an open
   source project. For example, the PSF may offer to sell conference
   proceedings, special Python distributions, or merchandise with distinctive
   insignia.
9. Publicizes, promotes the adoption of, and facilitates the ongoing development
   of Python-related technology and educational resources. This includes, but is
   not limited to, maintaining a public web site, planning Python conferences,
   and offering grants to Python-related open source projects.
10. Encourages and facilitates Python-related research in the public interest.

"Open source" is defined as: freely available technology licensed under terms
compatible with Version 1.9 (or later) of the Open Source Definition, as
established by the [Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/)
