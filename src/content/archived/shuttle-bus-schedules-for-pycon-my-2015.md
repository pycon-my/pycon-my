During registration, some of you requested for a shuttle bus from the Universiti LRT station to the venue. It can be quite a walk: 36 minutes based on Google Maps.

We're happy to announce that we'll have a bus for you for all 3 days of the conference.

Space is limited, and we will give priority to those who have indicated that they would like to take the shuttle bus during registration.

The timetable for the shuttle bus are as follows:

Friday 8/21 (Workshop Day): ================= From LRT Universiti station to the venue: 1. 7.45am

From the venue to LRT Universiti station: 1. 6.30pm (venue to LRT Universiti station)

Saturday 8/22 (Conference Day 1): ================= From LRT Universiti station to the venue: 1. 8.45am 2. 9.15am

From the venue to LRT Universiti station: 1. 5.15pm 2. 5.45pm

From the venue to LRT Universiti station: 1. 5.15pm 2. 5.45pm

Once you reached the LRT Universiti station, look for a bus with the sign "PyConMY 2015". One of our crew members wearing a red armband will be waiting for you and checking your name to make sure you have indicated shuttle bus request during registration.

Remember you will also be required to show your Peatix ticket for the conference when you board the bus.
