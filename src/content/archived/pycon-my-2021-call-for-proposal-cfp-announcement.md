Tutorials can be conducted in either **English** or **Bahasa Malaysia**.

##### PROJECT PRESENTATIONS

If you are working on a project, especially if it is open-source, we welcomed you to share it with us. We encourage the project to be presented in group. Having group members to present together used to be quite a challenge when the conference was conducted physically. Now, with everyone can be connected virtually, this could be done easily as long as there is a good internet connection.

The objective of this presentation format is to promote collaborations and continuous improvements. Each team will be given 30 minutes to present and 15 minutes to answer questions from community leaders and experts. Do not mistake this as a pitching session. It is NOT!
