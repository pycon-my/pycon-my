PyCon My 2019 is proud to announce Elastic as our Silver Sponsor.

Elastic is the company behind the Elastic Stack â€” that's Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, Elastic helps people explore and analyze their data differently using the power of search.

From the early days of Elasticsearch to how the ELK Stack came to be, a period of awesome development, the introduction of the Elastic Stack, and a new era of openness, at exactly 9:30 a.m. Eastern on October 5, the bell at the New York Stock Exchange rang out, officially making Elastic a public company. With a record-setting 230 Elasticians on the trading floor and hundreds more around the world, their distributed company celebrated reaching this remarkable milestone together.

Elastic has a team that collectively speaks a lot of languages. Spread around the world in over 30 countries, the team is trusted to do good work, supported when things get bumpy, empowered to think differently, push limits, and have a little fun in the process.
