We're announcing today that the subsidized ticket has reached it's allocated budget and is now SOLD OUT.

To reiterate on what is a _subsidized ticket_:

> **Subsidized tickets** The subsidized ticket is basically a half-priced ticket, from the actual cost of a person to attend the conference. You will get everything a full-priced ticket will get: Access to the conference, morning coffee/tea and snacks, lunch and coffee/tea breaks. Your attendance are being supported in half by our generous sponsors.
> 
> As such, we would like to ask you (the community) to only purchase the subsidized ticket if you can't afford the full-price ticket but you really would want to come to PyCon APAC 2017. This will usually mean you're a student, or you're coming from out-of-town, or you're coming with your own pocket money and you're coming to learn about the wonderful language and the people that make it happen. If you're sending in a talk proposal, please feel free to also purchase the subsidized ticket. The subsidized ticket is limited in number, so please think carefully before purchasing these.

The subsidized ticket **WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE** via a different arrangement for

- Conference speakers who's [Proposal](http://pycon.my/2017/02/25/speak-at-pycon-apac-2017/) has been selected
- Recipients of the [Financial Aid program](http://pycon.my/2017/03/27/financial-aid-for-pycon-apac-2017/)
