We have two announcements in this post: The first one is that unfortunately due to personal reasons, [Wes McKinney](http://pycon.my/2017/02/16/announcing-pycon-apac-2017-keynote-speaker-wes-mckinney/) has decided to withdraw from keynoting at our PyCon APAC conference this year. This is unfortunate, as we know many of us are looking forward for Wes's talk but we hope everything will go fine for Wes.

Nevertheless we still needed to find another keynote speaker to replace Wes, and so that brings us to the second announcement: We are now very muchÂ excited to announce that Luis Miguel Sanchez will be keynoting for our PyCon APAC 2017.
