## About Development Sprint

Development Sprint was held on 28th August 2017 at Makmal Mikro 1, Blok A, Fakulti Sains Komputer & Teknologi Maklumat, Universiti Malaya.

Our sprint lead is Mr. [Bhavani Shankar](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BhavaniShankar), a senior consultant for Accion Labs Pvt and he is also a community contributor for Ubuntu.

The sprint was consists of two parts:

1. Python package for Ubuntu (before lunch)
2. API testing using opencafe (after lunch)

## Development Sprint by the numbers

We managed to get 12 attendees out of 23 tickets sold.

## Rooms for Improvement

This is our first sprint session in PyCon MY, so the shortcomings are inevitable.

In term of communication, based on my cursory observation, most of the participants had problem understanding the speech because of the sprint leadâ€™s thick accent.

In term of content, I believe that the slides are too short and not really go in depth.

In term of time management, we ended our session too early. The session was supposed to end around 6PM but we ended at around 4PM.

In term of accommodations, we were not prepared to cater for people with disabilities and food restrictions (vegetarian). We had to make last minute plan on bringing the sprint lead and his wife to nearby vegetarian restaurant.

## Summary

We can do this again in future, but with much better planning. However, I personally believe that we (Pycon MY) should stick to workshop format unless if the sprint manager has experience working/participating on a sprint before.
