< Ivy Fung >

Started her career as a programmer, Ivy Fung moved on to take on management and sales and marketing roles. After spending a good decade in those roles, she was excited by the blockchain technology and decided to take a u-turn.  
With the experiences she gained as a Toastmaster, she focuses on training and technical writing. She spent 2019 training more than a hundred of lecturers in more than a dozen of universities about blockchain technology.  
Ivy joined Python community in order to rejuvenate her coding skills and ended up being more active in organising PyCon.
