The tickets for this year's PyCon APAC is now on sale via [Peatix](http://pycon-apac-2017.peatix.com).

The tickets will be on sale until 11:59PM August 12 2017 MYT, or until we run out of tickets, whichever comes first.

Ticket prices comparatively are much more expensive that they were last year for the local PyCon. We wanted a proper conference place, suitable for a APAC and overseas crowd so this year we've decided to go with [Connexion@Nexus Conference and Events Center](http://www.connexioncec.com/), which is known to host many international event. The venue itself has taken up nearly 60% of the total budget for the conference.

It is our hope though that many more people from the local community be still able to join us for PyCon APAC, so this year we're doing something different, by having a Financial Aid Program, to be announced sometime in March, and also introducing a **subsidized ticket**, alongside the normal priced tickets.

The subsidized ticket is basically a half-priced ticket, from the actual cost of a person to attend the conference. You will get everything a full-priced ticket will get: Access to the conference, morning coffee/tea and snacks, lunch and coffee/tea breaks. Your attendance are being supported in half by our generous sponsors. As such, we would like to ask you (the community) to only purchase the subsidized ticket if you can't afford the full-price ticket but you really would want to come to PyCon APAC 2017. This will usually mean you're a student, or you're coming from out-of-town, or you're coming with your own pocket money and you're coming to learn about the wonderful language and the people that make it happen. If you're sending in a talk proposal, please feel free to also purchase the subsidized ticket. The subsidized ticket is limited in number, so please think carefully before purchasing these. **Note that NO OFFICIAL RECEIPTS will be given out for subsidized tickets.**

As we would like to give every opportunity for locals to attend PyCon APAC, if you're coming from outside of Malaysia, or you're coming paid by your company and need a receipt, or if you're coming to pitch your business or recruit people, or if you're already successful in leveraging python in your business or life, or if you simply can afford it, we would like to ask you to purchase the full-price ticket.

Looking forward to meeting you at PyCon APAC 2017 in August!

_For this PyCon, conference tshirts will be sold separately via a separate ticket to reduce wastage. We will open sales for the tshirt tickets at a later date._
