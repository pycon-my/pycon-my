It's nerve-wrecking to speak in tech conferences, especially if this is your first attempt. First off, we as PyCon community like to emphasize that we are all for inclusive culture. In other words ...

> We are all awesome. You included. - [weareallaweso.me](http://weareallaweso.me/) -

If you are still mulling over whether you should do it, here are some reasons why:-

- **Self-branding** - I have nothing interesting to say! Find something you care about. Your background and experience are unique. _Know your worth, tell your story_.
- **Build a local community** - But I am an introvert! It's not about you (well, not all of it). It's about sharing your knowledge with others and diversity - especially if the topics that are important to you were _mis-represented_ or _under-represented_.
- **Get Exposure** - Conferences are where you meet interesting and amazing people you'll never have meet in your network. Enough said.

Here are some quick tips:-

- Start small - try 10-minutes Lightning Talk first, then slowly move on to longer talk / workshops.
- Seek out feedback from others and learn from it.
- Watch previous [PyCon on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX05-2sVSH7Nx3zuk3NYuQ) for inspiration BUT do not get intimidated. Just do your thing.
