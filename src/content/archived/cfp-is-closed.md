From 22nd March 2015 we have opened up calls for speakers via a public CfP and the time has come to close.  
  
Thank you all for your proposals: We will go through them and contact you within the next week, before the ticket on sale period ends to give you a chance to [buy your tickets](http://www.pycon.my/get-ticket). Due to the limited amount of slots, there is a possibility that your proposal cannot be accepted, but there will always be next year!
