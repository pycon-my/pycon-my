PyCon APAC started in Singapore in 2010 as a way for the regional python users and developers to get together at a place closer to home. By inviting keynote speakers and key python personalities from other parts of the world to the PyCon APAC, it has opened up opportunities for the regional python users and developers to collaborate and learn from one another.

After Singapore in 2010 to 2012, PyCon APAC moved to Tokyo in 2013, and was hosted twice by Taipei until 2015 and is in Seoul for 2016.

On the second day of #pyconapac2016 in Seoul, we have made the announcement that the regional **PyCon APAC for 2017 will return to South East Asia and be hosted in Kuala Lumpur.**

We are excited for this opportunity and believe it will much benefit the young but growing python community in this part of the world. Looking forward to seeing you in Kuala Lumpur in 2017!
