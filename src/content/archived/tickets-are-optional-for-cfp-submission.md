After discussing with the program team, and based on feedback by Ewa of the PSF and [Graham Dumpleton](https://twitter.com/GrahamDumpleton/status/855572751536472064), we've removed the requirement for the ticket and set [a new schedule for the Call For Proposals.](http://pycon.my/2017/02/25/speak-at-pycon-apac-2017/) 

We hope with the new schedule and no ticket restriction, we'll get much more proposals especially from overseas participants, and make it a truly APAC conference!
