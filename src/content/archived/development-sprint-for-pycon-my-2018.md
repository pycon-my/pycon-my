For PyCon MY 2018, we are organizing a one day development sprint event, where developers regardless of skill level get together with project maintainers to work on open source projects.

Development sprint events are a great way for you to meet and _actually_ work with experienced developers on interesting projects. More than often, conference development sprint events are where many new people start making their name working on open source projects. It's a great place to start if you have ever thought of contributing to Open Source projects, but did not know where to start.

Development sprints for PyCon MY 2018 will be held at the **Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.**

**Time: 10AM to 5:30PM** **Sprint Venue: Makmal Mikro 1, Blok A, FSKTM, University Malaya.**

**The sprint event is free, and you are not required to purchase a PyCon MY 2018 ticket, but space is limited: Please be considerate to other people that really is interested to join the sprints, and only get tickets if you can confirm that you can attend the event.**

If you're interested to participate in the sprints, please get your free tickets [here](https://pycon-my-2018-sprint.peatix.com/).
