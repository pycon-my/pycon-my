PyCon My 2019 is proud to announce AirAsia as our Gold Sponsor.

AirAsia Group services an extensive network across Asia-Pacific and South Asia, and comprises nine airline affiliates. We have 22,000 employees (the "AirAsia Allstars") from nearly 60 different nationalities. We have operations in five countries and operate 1,300 flights every day to over 130 destinations.

At AirAsia, we see ourselves as not so much an airline operator but more of a digital company that happens to be in the airline business.

AirAsia has sparked a revolution in air travel with more and more people around the region choosing us as their preferred choice of air transport. As we continuously strive to promote air travel, we also seek to create excitement among our guests with our range of innovative and personalized services.

Our mission is to attain the lowest cost so that everyone can fly with AirAsia and maintain the highest quality product, embracing technology to reduce cost and enhance service levels.

Together with our siblings, AirAsia X, Thailand AirAsia, Indonesia AirAsia, Philippines'​ AirAsia, AirAsia India and AirAsia Japan, we're set on charting courses to new horizons with the staunch belief that "Now Everyone Can Fly"​.

AirAsia has been awarded as the World's Best Low-Cost Airline for 11 consecutive years; 2009 - 2019 by Skytrax.
