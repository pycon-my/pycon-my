Audrey Feldroy

Audrey Feldroy is a programmer, writer, and artist. (To reduce system errors, she and husband Daniel simplified their last name from Roy Greenfeld to Feldroy.)

She wrote Cookiecutter in 2013, which has 12.6k GitHub stars. As co-author of Two Scoops of Django and Cookiecutter Django, her work has laid foundations for countless Django projects. She graduated from MIT in 2005 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science.

Audrey uses Python and JavaScript to laser-cut objects as art. She also paints, sculpts, and writes fiction novels and children's books. Her creative experiments can be found at https://audrey.feldroy.com.
