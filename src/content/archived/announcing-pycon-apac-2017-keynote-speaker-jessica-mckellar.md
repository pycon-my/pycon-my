> Jessica McKellar is an entrepreneur, software engineer, and open source developer from San Francisco. She is a former Director for the Python Software Foundation, PyCon North America's Diversity Outreach Chair, and a maintainer for several open source projects, including OpenHatch and the Twisted event-driven networking engine. For her outreach efforts in the Python community, she was awarded the O'Reilly Open Source Award in 2013.
> 
> Jessica is currently a founder and the CTO for an early-stage enterprise software startup. Previously, she was a founder and the VP of Engineering for a real-time collaboration startup acquired by Dropbox. Before that, she was a computer nerd at MIT who joined her friends at Ksplice, a company building a service for rebootless kernel updates on Linux that was acquired by Oracle. These diverse experiences earned her a place in the Forbes 30 under 30 class of 2017 for enterprise software.

We hope to give a warm welcome to Jessica to Kuala Lumpur and introduce her to our vibrant APAC community!
