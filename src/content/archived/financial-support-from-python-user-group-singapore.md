Our neighbor's [Python User Group Singapore](http://pugs.org.sg/) started the PyCon APAC conference for the first time in 2010, and have been a strong supporter in pushing the conference to be held around Asia Pacific region.

They have been strong moral and financial supporters for PyCon APAC conferences in different host cities, and they are also supporting us for this year.

**We have received financial support in the amount of SGD3000 from the PUG SG for our PyCon APAC this year.**

We would like to show our appreciation and thank you for their continuous and generous support!
