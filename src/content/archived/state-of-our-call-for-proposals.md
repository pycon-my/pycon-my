We're going to go through the current CfPs that we have, and write down a short summary to give you an idea of what kind of PyCon APAC you might be coming to in August.

Please keep in mind though that this post doesn't endorse or means that PyCon APAC will accept any of the proposals we've received so far: That will be done by the Program Team based on the [CfP schedule](http://pycon.my/2017/02/25/speak-at-pycon-apac-2017/) and will be announced on the 1st of August 2017.

### Data Science and Machine Learning

Topics around Data Science and Machine Learning have the highest numbers of CfPs that we're currently receiving. For example,

- Using Machine Learning in Structured Finance & Insurance
- Data Mining of News

are some of the talk title that we have received. Coupled with the fact that Wes McKinney will be keynoting for us, there seems to be a strong interest in data science and analytics this year.

### Business Applications, Python Libraries and Best Practices

After Data Science, Business Applications, Python Libraries and Best Practices topics are the second highest proposals that we have received so far. Titles like

- Write Elegant Concurrent Code in Python
- Velocity. Agility. Python.

Many people are keen to share how that have used python to get their jobs done and how it enriched their lives.

We're still open for CfPs, so please send in one!
