We've had great support from local and foreign companies for PyCon MY 2015, and we're also hoping for greater support this year for PyCon MY 2016.

You can download the [Sponsorship Prospectus](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxj_XxvZhpQRZE4xM2FJcnJnZWc) and see what sponsorship packages fits with your team and budget. Please contact the email addresses at the end of the prospectus for further information.

As anywhere else, PyCon  is a "by the community, for the community" conference, and without help in terms of financial sponsorship, exposure, talks and even attendance from the local enterprises and community, we couldn't do any of this.

Thank you in advance for the kind support.
