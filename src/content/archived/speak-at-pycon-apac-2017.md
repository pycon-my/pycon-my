# We Are Looking for speakers for PyCon APAC 2017

There are 3 types of format you can choose for your talk:

A standard talk session is a 30-minute session with a 10-minute Q&A at the end. Workshop is a 40-minute tutorial session and it can be a hands-on approach with the audience. Lightning talk is a 5-minute super quick session to talk on topic of your own interest.

Your talk can be for Beginners, Intermediate or Advance python users and developers.

We welcome many topics concerning the usage of development of python, and with this being a regional conference we will especially be interested in talks that showcases specific use cases your locale. An example of the topics that we're looking for are

- Web programming, including frameworks i.e Django, Flask, Pylons etc.)
-  Python in education, science and maths
- Machine learning and data science
- Python libraries, extending and embedding python in hardware
- GUI and games
- Best practices
- Network programming
- System administration
- Project case studies
- Community building and human interaction
- Programming tools
- Packaging
- Anything else basically which doesn't really fall into the types of topics above

Your talk can be conducted in English or Bahasa Malaysia although due to the regional aspect of APAC please note that there will be participants who will not understand Bahasa.
