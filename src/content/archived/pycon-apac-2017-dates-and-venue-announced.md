As initially announced [here](http://pycon.my/2016/08/17/pycon-apac-2017-in-kuala-lumpur/) PyCon APAC 2017 will be held in Kuala Lumpur, organized by PYCON MY PLT.

We are happy and excited to announce that the dates and the venue for this year's PyCon APAC conference are as follows:

> **Dates: Aug 26 (Sat) to Aug 27 (Sun) 2017**  **Venue: Connexion Conference & Event Centre in [Bangsar South, Kuala Lumpur.](http://www.bangsarsouth.com/location/)**

**We'll also have a one day sprint event, on Aug 25 (Fri) OR Aug 28 (Mon) 2017, depending on venue availability.** This will be a separate event than the conference and we'll update on the details of the venue nearer to the date.

The overall theme for this year's PyCon APAC is **Taming Python:** Being this year's regional PyCon conference, we hope to showcase how python is being used to solve problems unique to each locale, or how we use python to solve our many different problems.
