On the 29th of April 2016 we made a second site visit to the Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, International University of Malaya-Wales and the Dean of the faculty, Prof. Dr. Patrice brought us around the campus showing us the facilities which will be available for PyCon MY 2016.

We spent around over 2 hours going around the facilities planning how the event can fit well with what will be available for us.

TheÂ Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics IUMW is also around 520 meters from the Putra Komuter train station, and will take you around 7 minutes to walk from the station to the faculty building.
