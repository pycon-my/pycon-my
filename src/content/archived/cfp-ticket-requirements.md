Currently as part of the [Call For Proposals submission](http://pycon.my/2017/02/25/speak-at-pycon-apac-2017/) we're requiring the submitter to purchase a ticket, as a measure to ensure that the submitter will attend PyCon APAC 2017. This measure has received multiple feedbacks, especially from overseas would-be speakers who believes this puts an extra financial burden on them, without the certainty if they will speak or not in the first place.

As it is apparent right now, this measure is discouraging a more active participation for PyCon APAC. We will revisit our program selection schedule within the next week and make changes to the CfP process to allow for an easier submission process.
