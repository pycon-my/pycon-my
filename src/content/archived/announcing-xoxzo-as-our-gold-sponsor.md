Here's some words from **Xoxzo:-**

> Xoxzo is a cloud telephony platform for web developers, created by a diverse 100% remote team from Russia to Japan.Simple APIs and documentation that show you how you can leverage the phone with a single line of code: Make calls, receive calls, subscribe phone numbers,and send SMS, all with just POST and GET.

We use python on 99% of our code, donate to the Django project and have been supporting PyCon since 2010. We are very excited to be part of PyCon MY 2018!

We are very thankful to Xoxzo for supporting the PyCon community by sponsorship to PyCon MY 2018!
