Today we met with the 15 volunteers that will help us as part of the staff for PyCon MY 2016.

We spent 2 hours going through the Code Of Conduct, Issues Handling, and conference day Playbook documents before walking around campus making final checks for registration tables, lunch arrangements and other logistics issues.

The students have elected among themselves a volunteer leader to act as a manager assigning the various roles to other volunteers.

Thank you to IUMW for allowing us to work with the students, and thank you to our volunteers for their help to make PyCon MY 2016 a comfortable and successful conference.
