PyCon My 2019 is proud to announce Jublia as our Tech Sponsor.

"At Jublia, we enable people to discover useful content and meet relevant others through intelligent matching technologies at events. We are proud to do our small part within the community to sponsor this coming edition of Pycon Malaysia 2019. After a successful exposure as a sponsor in Pycon APAC and Pycon Indonesia in 2018, we are glad to go to Malaysia and look out for promising talents in the region. Python is the one to rule them all in Jublia. She is utilised throughout our organisation and systems to deliver a stable, secure and high performance enterprise grade platform."
