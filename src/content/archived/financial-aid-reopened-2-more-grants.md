Update: With only 4 weeks away from the PyCon APAC 2017 event, we have some good news to share.

We have decided to extend the Financial Aid Program to provide RM500 for another two individuals to attend the event. Thus, we will be receiving applications to be considered for the financial aid program for the next 2 weeks. The new closing date is 8 August 2017 (12.00am).
