Slow applications are no fun. Application performance monitoring (APM) makes tracking down issues much easier. But which tools should you use?

With the release of Elastic APM, there’s a new option. The language server and clients are fully open source (Apache 2.0) so you can get started with any app.

Elastic’s APM was released some time ago, so it’s a very fresh option for tracing performance problems in {x language} applications (and other runtimes as well). The basic platform is free so it should be a welcome change for {x language} developers used to spending huge bills on comparable hosted platforms.

In this session, Aravind will enclose Elastic APM useful out of the box tracing basics on web requests, including:

\- Request details  
\- Response time percentiles  
\- Transaction timelines  
\- Application errors and stack traces  
\- Individual code lines  
\- Distributed Tracing

It can also be used to track any custom span in any {x} application to find out where time is being lost and users are being slowed down.

Aravind is passionate about evangelizing technology, meeting developers, and helping in solving their problems. He is a backend developer and has eight years of development experience.

Currently, he works at Elastic as a Developer Advocate and looks after the Developer Relation function of India, South East Asia. Previously, He worked at McAfee Antivirus as a Senior Software Engineer in Cloud Security Domain. He has a deep interest in Search, Machine Learning, Security Incident Analysis, and IoT tech. In his free time, he plays around with RPi or Arduino.
