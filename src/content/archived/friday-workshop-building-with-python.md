Title: Building with Python

1.1 About the workshop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You already have some experience with at least one other language and
 now would like to learn how to code in Python and how to build your

Getting involved in the Python community is a great way to quickly
 learn and hone your Python skills. This one-day workshop will provide
 you a broad flavour of the language as well as to build a strong
 foundation for you to step into the diverse application domains of
 Python on your own.

First we gain some understanding of the language by playing with some
 code snippets. Then we introduce a simple text-based game which
 covers importing modules, random numbers, loops, data type conversion,
 input from user and other topics. We will also discuss what libraries
 are available to build your Python applications.

 one other programming language.

 - Python 3 preinstalled (from https://www.python.org/downloads/).
 - A programmer's editor you are comfortable with.

1.3 Learning outcomes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
