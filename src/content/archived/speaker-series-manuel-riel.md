![DSC_0134-M copy - Manu Madaris](images/dsc_0134-m-copy-manu-madaris.jpg)Manuel started out by selling tailor-made shirts from China to Europe using a badly-coded PHP site. He then continued to run a web design and consulting agency before getting involved with open source projects, like Debian and Borg Backup.

Currently, he lives in Kuala Lumpur and runs BorgBase.com, a backup hosting based on Borg Backup, Django and Vue.js.

**Topic:** Integrating GraphQL with Django.

This talk is targeting Python web developers. It first introduces the GraphQL syntax and the differences with REST. Next, we will build a simple Django backend with a Vue.js frontend. In the process we will learn how to effectively map Django models to GraphQL, add authentication and test our new API.

Targeting audience with intermediate level of Python knowledge.
