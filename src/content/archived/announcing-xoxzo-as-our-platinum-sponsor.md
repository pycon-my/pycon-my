Xoxzo (https://www.xoxzo.com) is a cloud telephony platform for web developers, created by a diverse 100% remote team from Russia to Japan. Simple APIs and documentation that show you how you can leverage the phone with a single line of code: Make calls, receive calls, subscribe phone numbers, and send SMS, all with just POST and GET.

From our sponsor

Founded in 2007, Xoxzo has no offices but the team gets together somewhere on the planet a few times a year, with PyCon conferences as one of them.

We use python on 99% of our code, donate to the Django project and have been supporting PyCon since 2010. We are very excited to be part of PyCon APAC 2017!

We thank XOXZO for the support for this conference!
