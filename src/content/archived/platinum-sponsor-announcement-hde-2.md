We’re thrilled to announce our Platinum Sponsor for PyCon APAC: [HDE based in Tokyo](https://hde.co.jp/en/)! HDE has been very supportive of PyCon in the Asia Pacific region, and this year marks their entrance as sponsors for PyCon APAC.

About HDE:

> The last goal of a business is making a profit and contributing to the society through it.
>
> Since we started our business in 1996, we have faithfully worked on how we can make the world better with our new technology.
>
> Our concept of “liberating technology” harbors the hopes that more of our customers can benefit from high-end technology including ours; we believe it can change the world better.
>
> Through the technology, we’d ultimately like to make a new value and contribute to the world economy. Also, we are sure it will return us a bigger benefit by the expansion of the world economy when we pursue common good other than monopolistic trivial gain.
>
> “Accept the present needs and create original but practical solutions.” “Invigorate Japanese IT industry and distribute the interest to as many people as possible.” These are the first step to our goal, which will prove our desire to the intellectual horizon, as well.
>
> As we have done, we will never stop being creative in the future.

HDE believes the potential that Malaysia has, and are excited to tie up with local businesses and also are interested to meet talented engineers during PyCon APAC 2017.
