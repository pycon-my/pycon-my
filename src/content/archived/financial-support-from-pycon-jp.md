PyCon MY and [PyCon JP](https://www.pycon.jp/committee/index.html) go back a long way: Our chair for PyCon APAC 2017 this year is also a founding and board member of PyCon JP. The members of PyCon JP came for PyCon MY 2015 to show their support, and through PyCon JP, we were connected to various sponsors from Japan that has helped made what PyCon MY it is today.

We are happy and honored to announce that we have **received aid in the amount of USD5000 from PyCon JP.** We were made to understand that this aid is a pledge made by PyCon JP as part of their effort to help make PyCon APAC a success in other communities: PyCon JP received aid from PyCon SG when they organized PyCon APAC in 2013, and they believe now it is the time for them to return back the favor.

We would like to thank you PyCon JP and the JP community for their much needed and continuous support!
