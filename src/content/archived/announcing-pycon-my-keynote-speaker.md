#### Tarek Ziadé

> [Tarek](http://ziade.org/) is an engineering manager at Mozilla, using Python for most of his projects. He was involved a few years ago in helping fixing the packaging issues in Python itself, and has many crazy stories about that. He's also authored several books and has developed a passion for running and playing trumpet.

We're delighted to give him hearty welcome to Kuala Lumpur this year and looking forward to seeing him at PyCon MY. More speakers will be announced soon.

[PyCon MY 2016](https://pycon.my/2016/02/06/pycon-my-2016-venues-and-dates/) is happening this year from 26 August 2016 to 28 August 2016 at  [International University of Malaya-Wales (IUMW)](http://www.iumw.edu.my/), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
