More good news when you attend PyCon MY 2015 in August:

[O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/), the chronicler and catalyst of leading-edge development, is generous enough to offer us discount codes through their O'Reilly's Partner Program for EVERYONE attending PyCon MY 2015!

_The discount code will be good for 40% off most print and 50% off most ebooks and videos on [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/)._

[![O'Reilly Media](/archived-images/be684-orm_logo_box75_hex.jpg)](http://www.oreilly.com/)

_What's the discount code?_ Well, I will only tell you on the event day, of course!

Thank you to the team at O'Reilly for making this happen.
