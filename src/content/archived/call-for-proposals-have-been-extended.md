Hi Everyone,  
  
According to our original schedule, the CfP deadline is 3rd July 2015. 
  
Because we would like to give as much opportunity as possible for speakers to gain from our [sponsor giveaway](http://pyconmy.blogspot.com/2015/06/free-aws-credits-to-attendees-and.html), we have decided to **extend the deadline to 10th July 2015.**  
  
Hooray!  
  
**The selected CfP announcement is unchanged at 24th July 2015.**  
  
So do you have a story to tell about how you use your python? Send them [here](http://www.pycon.my/call-for-proposal)!
