We're extending the deadline for call for talk proposal originally posted [here](http://pycon.my/2016/02/26/call-for-talk-proposals-cfp-pycon-my-2016/) to June 10th, as we had requests from would be speakers for more time.

If you have anything interesting to share (It doesn't have to be a totally technical talk at all), we would be happy to have you!

You can submit your proposal(s) here:Â [http://bit.ly/pyconmy2016cfp](http://bit.ly/pyconmy2016cfp)
