Today we went to have our second site visit to our venue at Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University Malaya. We'll be having our PyCon MY 2015 conference in the B Block

The Faculty currently is going through some heavy construction which is taking up space in the parking lots behind the Faculty. This has the effect of reducing the amount of parking bays available, so we hope that participants can car pool or take public transportation to the venue.

Other than that, everything else looks good and we're confident it will be an enjoyable weekend of pure Python goodness.

Looking forward to meeting you there!
