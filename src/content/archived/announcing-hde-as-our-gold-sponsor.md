We are happy to announce [HDE](https://hde.co.jp/en/) as our Gold sponsor for PyCon MY 2018!

Here's some words from **HDE:-**

> HDE is one of the first IT ventures in Japan, established 22 years ago. Owning over 73% market share in the whole of Japan, HDE is the #1 cloud-based security provider based in Tokyo, Japan.
> 
> With over 3.5 million users in over 4,000 companies, weâ€™ve keenly presented ourselves in the global plenary; from expanding our business to global plenary, to changing our main language to English and having 20% of our employees international. As our business continuously grows and expands, we are looking for talented engineers (front-end, back-end, data) to join our team in Tokyo.

We are very thankful to HDE for supporting the PyCon community by sponsorship to PyCon MY 2018!

[PyCon MY](http://pycon-my-2018.peatix.com) is happening from 25 August to 26 August 2018 at University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (**our venue partner**).
