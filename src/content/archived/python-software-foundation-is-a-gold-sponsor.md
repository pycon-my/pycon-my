The PyCon MY 2016 organizing team is proud and excited to announce that we have received confirmation the [Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/) has agreed to send us a grant equivalent to a Gold Sponsor amount.

_The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a [diverse](https://www.python.org/psf/diversity/)Â and international community of Python programmers._

Thank you to the PSF for their continued support [from 2015](http://pycon.my/2015/06/10/announcing-our-special-sponsor-for-pycon-my-2015-python-software-foundation-psf/).
