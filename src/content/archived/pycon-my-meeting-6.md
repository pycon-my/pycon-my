Hello.  
Iqbal writing for the PyCon My Blog.  
  
We had the 6th organizers meeting for PyCon MY 2015 yesterday. We discussed updates and issues concerning ticketing and also sponsorships. Ras will be working to finalize our sponsorship packages, and I will be finalizing the ticketing page. We target to have these two released by the end of this month.  
  
Slowly but surely, everything is falling in place for a great PyCon!
