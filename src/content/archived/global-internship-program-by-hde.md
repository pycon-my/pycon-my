As our [Platinum sponsor for PyCon MY 2016](http://pycon.my/2016/05/17/platinum-sponsor-announcement-hde/), HDE will be joining us during PyCon MY 2016 in Kuala Lumpur and will be interested in meeting potential candidates for their [Global Internship Program](https://www.hde.co.jp/en/gip/) or GIP.

The GIP is a program that (from their website)

> _Offers internship position providing opportunities for student to experience practical application development skill using mostly Python/Golang/Erlang. Also, this internship position will provide opportunities to develop application by using Amazon Web Services/Google App Engine. Conversations in the office will be done in English, so that Japanese communication skill is NOT required. The internship will be within the Cloud Product Development division of HDE, Inc. located in Tokyo, Japan._

To find out more what it's like joining the GIP, you can visit it's [Facebook Page](http://facebook.com/hde.global.)

Up until now, HDE has welcomed interns from Ukraine, The USA, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Thailand to name a few. We also know there are Malaysians who are playing important roles in the company.

The internship program also includes benefits by HDE such as:

- This internship is a training program without a salary. But, HDE will assists your stay in Japan by subsidizing up to 150,000yen/month for your living costs such as foods, commuting expenses, and apartment fee.
- Students can find monthly apartments near our office. (ex. http://www.sakura-house.com/en/ )
- We will pay the insurance cost and international airfares to Japan.
- There will be a chance to be a full time worker according to intern's outputs.

If you've just graduated from college or are currently in your final year of studying Computer Science and have ever wanted to experience what living (and working) in Tokyo would be like, **this is a great opportunity to find out.** Depending on how you did during the internship program, there is even a chance of getting a position with HDE!
