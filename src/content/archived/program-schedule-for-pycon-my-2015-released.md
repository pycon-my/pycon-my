We've released our Program Schedule for PyCon MY 2015 here:

[http://www.pycon.my/pycon-my-2015-1/program](http://www.pycon.my/pycon-my-2015-1/program)

This year we have a bunch of interesting talks, from beginner to intermediate level, ranging from topics such as payments, web services, concurrency, best practices, documentation, Raspberry Pi and even _Python For Kids_.

These are basically fixed, but will still be subject to change if something else comes up. We plan to move the Program Schedule to [Guidebook](https://guidebook.com/)Â sooner rather than later where we can also upload speaker information and a bunch of other useful stuff and take down the Program Schedule on the website, so bear with us.
