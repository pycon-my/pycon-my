We're excited again this year to announce our start of the CFP for [PyCon MY 2016, which will be held from 26th to 28th August](http://pycon.my/2016/02/06/pycon-my-2016-venues-and-dates/). The **deadline for proposals is 28th May 2016.**

PyCon MY attracts professional developers from all walks of life, including industry, government, and science, as well as enthusiast and student developers. We're looking for proposals for presentations and tutorials on any aspect of Python programming, at all skill levels from novice to advanced.

Presentation subjects may range from reports on open source, academic or commercial projects; or even tutorials and case studies. If a presentation is interesting and useful to the Python community, it will be considered for inclusion in the program. Following our tradition of [Everybody Pays](http://jessenoller.com/blog/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays) for PyCon, you'll still need to buy tickets even if your proposal is accepted.

This year's theme is about building cool things in Python, but really we are all ears for any kind of topics!

## First time speakers

We welcome first time speakers! If you have friends or colleagues who have something valuable to contribute, please also forward this Call for Proposals to anyone that you feel may be interested. As a community, we are eager to hear about your experience.

## Talk formats

Presenters are given 30 minutes including 10 minutes of Q&A session for talks. If you are more interested in teaching, you might want to try the workshop format where you can engage with participants better. The length for workshop can be from 2 hours up to 4 hours. If that's not your thing and you like to quickly show or tell people about anything that particularly interesting for you (and the audience), try the lightning talk. It's only 5-minutes long.

You can submit your proposal here: [http://bit.ly/pyconmy2016cfp](http://bit.ly/pyconmy2016cfp)
