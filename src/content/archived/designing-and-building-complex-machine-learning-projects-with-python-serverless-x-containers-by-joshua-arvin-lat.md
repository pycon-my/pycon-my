Over the past couple of years, several professionals and teams have started to utilize serverless and container concepts and techniques to design and build scalable, low cost, and maintainable applications. Understanding the concepts alone will not guarantee success especially when dealing with modern complex requirements involving Machine Learning and Data Engineering. It is critical that professionals and teams are aware of the solutions which work and the solutions which may not work in production.

In this session, Arvs will share the different strategies on how to design, build, deploy, and maintain serverless and container applications and his goal is to bridge the gap between reality and expectations.

Joshua Arvin Lat is the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Combinate, Insites, and Jepto. For the past couple of years, he has been sharing his knowledge in several international conferences and events to discuss practical strategies for companies and professionals. In addition to this, he is an AWS Machine Learning Hero and serves as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in machine learning and machine learning engineering.
