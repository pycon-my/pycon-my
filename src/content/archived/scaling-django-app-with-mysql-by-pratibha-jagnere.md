In recent years, we have noticed high reluctance towards MySQL claiming that it is not scalable, however, the names of tech giants like Twitter and Facebook in list of MySQL customers raise suspicion. MySQL has been criticized for being hard to scale, and sometimes thatâ€™s true, but usually you can make MySQL scale well if you choose the right architecture and implement it well.

We can build Django applications with MySQL that can grow very large while remaining fast, efficient, and economical. In this workshop, we want to show how we can use MySQL as backend Database in Django Application and still provide scalable infrastructure.

Pratibha is a Senior Python Engineer of her company looking over the development and maintenance of backend including RESTful APIs and creating internal python packages.
