**Topic:** Studi.MY : A case study of a Python outreach program.

Studi.MY was an idea hatched to reach out to the public who are interested in learning Python, to introduce to them the best practices in coding and the world of open source. We learnt about consumer behaviours, the local market, and obstacles that we had not expected before we got our hands on it.

Targeting audience with beginner level of Python knowledge.
