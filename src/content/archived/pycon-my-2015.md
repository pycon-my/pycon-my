After a successful Mini PyCon back in 2014, PyCon Malaysia kick-started on 21st of August 2015; bringing together 108 registrants, 18 speakers in 21 informative sessions!

Sponsored by a line of sponsors: Python Software Foundation (PSF), OnApp, SolutionsX, Braintree_PayPal, HITB, and Amazon Web Services, this three-day event consists of a workshop on the first day and conference on the next two days. The event was held at University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur. According to the PyCon MY 2015 chairperson, Iqbal Abdullah, Kuala Lumpur served as an apt location for the conference; from ease of accommodation to transportation.

The one day workshop, which targeted non-programmers was conducted by Victor Yap. This workshop was able to give a glimpse of various practices of programming and its respective implementations in the current era. The attendees were also enlightened via demonstration, on how Python can be applied to mitigate real-world problems.

Our keynote speakers Marcus Low and Mark Rees spoke about how Python has changed their lives for good. Marcus indicated how widely Python is being used in popular applications like _Instagram_ and _PinInterest_. Mark Rees on the other hand, provided insights of how programming has evolved since older days, and yet how Python still remained his favorite.
