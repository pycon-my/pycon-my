Great news! We're announcing today that we are extending subsidized ticket of **RM 130** to students. Simply fill up this [Google form](https://goo.gl/TSoGfS) and we'll send you a unique discount code.

To reiterate on what is a _subsidized ticket_:

> **Subsidized tickets** The subsidized ticket is basically a reduced-priced ticket, from the actual cost of a person to attend the conference. You will get everything a full-priced ticket will get: Access to the conference, morning coffee/tea and snacks, lunch and coffee/tea breaks. Your attendance are being supported in half by our generous sponsors.
> 
> As such, we would like to ask you (the community) to only purchase the subsidized ticket if you are a student and you can't afford the full-price ticket but you really would want to come to PyCon MY 2018. The subsidized ticket is limited in number, so please think carefully before purchasing these.

Note: Travel stipend will be available via a different arrangement for conference speakers whose proposal has been selected.

[PyCon MY](http://pycon-my-2018.peatix.com) is happening from 25 August to 26 August 2018 at University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (**our venue partner**).
