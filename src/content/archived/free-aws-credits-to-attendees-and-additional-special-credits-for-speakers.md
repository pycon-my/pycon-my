With [Amazon Web Services (AWS) becoming our F&B sponsors](http://pyconmy.blogspot.com/2015/06/announcing-our-f-sponsor-for-pycon-my.html) we're thrilled to also announce that they have also agreed to give away free AWS credits during PyCon MY 2015.

Thank you [Matthew G](https://www.flickr.com/photos/streetmatt/) for the lovely picture. No changes was made.

  

**All** registered attendees (just purchasing tickets but not coming doesn't make you eligable) of PyCon MY 2015 will be presented with free AWS credits, with speakers getting _extra special credits on top of those free credits_, courtesy of AWS.

  

_How many free credits?_ No, I'm not going to tell you now. (lol

  

In order for you to receive the free credits, we would need to pass to AWS your registered email address and name and they will contact you directly. So make sure your particulars are correct.

  

If you for some reason or another would not want your details to be known to AWS, please inform us during registration at the venue. In that case, please understand that you will not be eligible for the free credits.
