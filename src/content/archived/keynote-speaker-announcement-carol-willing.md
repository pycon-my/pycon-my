Carol earned a BSE in Electrical Engineering from Duke University and an MS in Management from MIT. Her education and work experience in small and large companies taught her to respect the value of “using what you have learned to make something better and sharing what you know with others”.

Carol is currently a Steering Council member and developer for Project Jupyter. She is also member of the inaugural Python Steering Council, a Python Software Foundation Fellow and former Director; a core developer on CPython, Jupyter, nteract, AnitaB.org’s open source projects, and PyLadies; a co-organizer of PyLadies San Diego and San Diego Python User Group; an independent developer of hardware and software. Weaving her love of art, music, and nature with wearable soft circuits, she is developing an open hardware project to assist an in-home caregiver with gentle, compassionate support of a loved one with Alzheimer’s.

Today, she spends much of her time learning and inspiring others to blend their unique interests and technology to create something new, silly, beautiful, or helpful.
